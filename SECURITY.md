## Security Features

### Built-in Security Measures

Our tool implements several security-by-design principles:

#### Data Protection
- **Local Processing Only**: All scanning occurs locally; no data transmitted to external services
- **No Telemetry**: Zero data collection, analytics, or usage tracking
- **Temporary Storage**: Scan results stored only in local directories with configurable retention
- **Configurable Redaction**: Sensitive findings can be masked in outputs

#### Code Security
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Pure bash implementation reduces attack surface
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are sanitized and validated
- **Privilege Separation**: Runs with minimal required permissions
- **Secure Defaults**: Conservative configuration out-of-the-box

#### Supply Chain Security
- **Signed Releases**: All releases are GPG-signed for integrity verification
- **Checksums**: SHA-256 checksums provided for all artifacts
- **Open Source**: Full code transparency enables community security audits
- **Dependency Tracking**: Minimal external dependencies with regular updates

### Compliance Alignment

This tool supports various compliance frameworks:

#### Standards Supported
- **PCI DSS 4.0**: Payment card data detection and protection
- **HIPAA**: Healthcare information safeguards
- **SOX**: Financial audit trail requirements
- **GDPR**: Personal data discovery and protection
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management alignment
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Security controls mapping

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### Installation Security
- ‚úÖ **Verify Downloads**: Always verify checksums and signatures
- ‚úÖ **Use Official Sources**: Download only from official GitHub releases
- ‚úÖ **Review Code**: Inspect installation scripts before execution
- ‚úÖ **Minimal Permissions**: Run with least required privileges

#### Usage Security
- ‚úÖ **Never Commit Results**: Exclude scan outputs from version control
- ‚úÖ **Secure Storage**: Store scan results in encrypted filesystems
- ‚úÖ **Access Control**: Limit access to scan results to authorized personnel
- ‚úÖ **Regular Updates**: Keep tool updated to latest security patches

#### CI/CD Security
- ‚úÖ **Secrets Management**: Use secure secret storage for CI/CD environments
- ‚úÖ **Isolated Execution**: Run scans in sandboxed environments
- ‚úÖ **Result Handling**: Secure transmission and storage of scan results
- ‚úÖ **Audit Logging**: Maintain logs of all security scans

### For Developers

#### Contribution Security
- ‚úÖ **Code Review**: All contributions undergo security review
- ‚úÖ **Signed Commits**: Use GPG-signed commits for integrity
- ‚úÖ **Dependency Review**: New dependencies require security assessment
- ‚úÖ **Testing**: Include security test cases for new features
