# üõ°Ô∏è Security Policy

## Our Commitment

Git Security Audit Framework is a security tool designed to help developers and organizations protect their repositories. We take security seriously and follow responsible disclosure practices for any vulnerabilities found in our project.

## Supported Versions

We actively maintain and provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          | End of Life |
| ------- | ------------------ | ----------- |
| 2.x.x   | ‚úÖ Active Support  | TBD         |
| 1.x.x   | ‚ö†Ô∏è Security fixes only | 2025-12-31 |
| < 1.0   | ‚ùå No Support      | 2024-06-01  |

## Security Features

### Built-in Security Controls
- üîç **Self-scanning**: Our CI/CD pipeline scans our own code for secrets
- üîê **Signed releases**: All releases are GPG-signed for authenticity
- üìã **Dependency scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning with Dependabot
- üõ°Ô∏è **CodeQL analysis**: Advanced static analysis for potential security issues

### Secure Development Practices
- **Principle of least privilege**: Script runs with minimal required permissions
- **Input validation**: All user inputs are properly sanitized
- **Safe defaults**: Conservative configuration defaults to prevent accidental exposure
- **No network calls**: Script operates entirely offline for security

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### üö® Critical Vulnerabilities

For **critical security vulnerabilities** that could impact user data or repository security:

**DO NOT** create a public issue. Instead:

1. **Email us privately**: [security@git-security-audit.com](mailto:security@git-security-audit.com)
2. **Use our security form**: [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/Franklin-Andres-Rodriguez/git-security-audit/security/advisories/new)
3. **PGP encryption** (optional): Use our [public key](https://keybase.io/Franklin-Andres-Rodriguez) for sensitive details

### üìã What to Include

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Before Using the Tool

1. **Verify integrity**: Check GPG signatures on releases
   ```bash
   # Verify release signature
   gpg --verify git-security-audit-v2.0.0.tar.gz.sig
   ```

2. **Review permissions**: Understand what the script accesses
   ```bash
   # Script only needs read access to .git directory
   ls -la .git/
   ```

3. **Use in isolated environment**: For untrusted repositories
   ```bash
   # Run in container for maximum isolation
   docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/repo security-audit:latest
   ```

### During Usage

1. **Protect output**: Audit reports may contain sensitive data
   ```bash
   # Set secure permissions on audit directory
   chmod 700 security-audit/
   ```

2. **Review findings carefully**: Validate all detected secrets before taking action

3. **Secure cleanup**: Properly dispose of audit files
   ```bash
   # Secure deletion of audit files
   shred -vfz -n 3 security-audit/findings/*.txt
   ```

### After Scanning

1. **Rotate compromised credentials**: Act on findings immediately
2. **Clean Git history**: Use tools like git-filter-repo for permanent removal
3. **Implement prevention**: Add pre-commit hooks to prevent future issues

## Compliance & Certifications

### Standards Compliance
- ‚úÖ **OWASP ASVS v4.0**: Application Security Verification Standard
- ‚úÖ **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover
- ‚úÖ **CIS Controls**: Center for Internet Security Critical Security Controls

### Audit Information
- **Last Security Review**: 2024-12-01
- **Next Scheduled Review**: 2025-06-01

## Security Incident Response

### For Project Maintainers

If a security incident occurs:

1. **Immediate containment**: Remove vulnerable versions from distribution
2. **Impact assessment**: Determine scope and affected users  
3. **Communication**: Notify users through multiple channels
4. **Remediation**: Deploy fixes and updated versions
5. **Post-incident review**: Learn and improve our processes

### For Users

If you suspect a security incident related to our tool:

1. **Stop using the affected version** immediately
2. **Report the incident** using our vulnerability reporting process
3. **Monitor our security advisories** for updates
4. **Apply security patches** as soon as available
